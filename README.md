# project overview
This project aims to reflect the process of building community through different individual people from various places in one’s life. It is a topic close to me because of my experiences as a child moving away from my friends over and over. As an adult, this feeling of fragmented community stays with me because the groups I have been a part of are far away, don’t align with my values, or I have since seperated from. The song "Make Friends" by Hiatus Kayote reflects the way we choose people important to us and form our own community in our lifetime. The lyrics I picked from the song express all of this as well as design elements like font, color, shape, and small animations.

# technical overview
These pages are being built in Visual Studio code using the html and css languages. It is being hosted as a live website through GitHub. Many hover effects are used to signify where to click to get to the next page, and the design choices for animation, color, and font are the main method of communication. 

# acknowledgment
Thank you to Hiatus Kayote for their beautiful lyrics I used from their song "Make Friends," and thank you to google fonts for the fonts I used in this project.
